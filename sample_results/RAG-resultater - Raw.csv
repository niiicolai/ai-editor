Which files might have too many lines of code?,"To determine which files might have too many lines of code, you would typically look at code files such as:

1. **Main Application Files**: These are usually the core files where the primary logic of the application is implemented. They can become quite large if not managed properly.

2. **Configuration Files**: Files like `settings.py`, `config.js`, or `.env` can grow in size, especially if they contain many configuration options.

3. **Testing Files**: If there is a large number of test cases, files related to testing (such as those running with Vitest, as mentioned in the README.md) can also become lengthy.

4. **Modules or Libraries**: Custom modules or libraries that implement various functionalities can accumulate a lot of code.

5. **Documentation Files**: While not traditional code files, any extensive documentation, such as `README.md`, can become lengthy, especially if it includes detailed instructions or examples.
