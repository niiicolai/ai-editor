# Introduction
This project includes seven backend services that manage authentication, payments, LLM communication, email delivery, vector embedding generation, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) evaluation. It also features two client applications: a web interface used for showcasing the product, managing purchases, user profiles, and related functionality; and a desktop IDE that integrates a chat module with an AI assistant. The assistant is capable of reading and listing files from the open directory and accessing autogenerated QA content to support RAG-based interactions.

Each application includes its own README file with installation and usage instructions.

The project is intended for educational use and has been tested on macOS 11 and Windows 11.
